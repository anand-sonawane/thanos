So, just like the **Infinity stones** thanos gathers and use them to show his love towards the Mistress of Death,
**Lets gather all the super powers in Computer Vision together,as if they are the Infinity stones.**

This Repo is basically a wrapper on top of Keras which will let you build basic Computer Vision models with one line on the terminal, the steps to do, models available and instructions are mentioned below.
